# Project

## Created a new project with Streamlit and Python 

[]: # Language: python
[]: # Path: Streamlit_and_Python.py
[]: # Path: readme.md

## Run the below code in the terminal to start the project with the terminal
streamlit run Streamlit_and_Python.py

## The perpose of this project was to get familiar with Streamlit and Python. In this project we will be creating a simple web application that will display a several interactive plots and maps. With the maps you will be able to answer the following questions:

#Where are most people injured in NYC?
#How many crashes at between any time of the day in NYC?
#Breakdown of the crashes by the type of injury in the raw data. 
#Breakdown of the crashes by the minute. 
#Top 5 dangerous streets by affected type


Use the code and graphs in any way you like. Let me know if you would like for me to add more features to the project. Cheers :)
